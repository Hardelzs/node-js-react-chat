# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Chat App (Frontend Functional, Backend Incomplete)

Welcome to the Chat App project! This is an application designed for real-time messaging and communication. While the frontend of the app is functional and ready to use, please note that the backend is still a work in progress.

## Overview

The Chat App is intended to provide users with the ability to chat in real-time, create rooms, and exchange messages. The frontend of the application has been successfully implemented and offers a user-friendly interface for chatting with others. However, the backend, which handles user authentication, message storage, and room management, is not functioning correctly at the moment.

## Features

### Frontend (Functional)

- User registration and login.

### Backend (Incomplete)

- User authentication issues.
- Message storage and retrieval not working.
- Room management features not fully implemented.

## Project Status

As of now, the frontend of the Chat App is functional and ready for use. Users can register, log in, create rooms, and send messages in real-time. However, the backend is encountering issues that affect user authentication, message storage, and room management.

## Getting Started

### Frontend (Functional)

You can use the frontend of the Chat App by accessing the provided URL or running it locally. The frontend is operational and ready for use.
